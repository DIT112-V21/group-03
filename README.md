## Product description 

### What is Smart Pet Buddy? 

Our product is a Smart Pet Buddy app based on a smart car platform that provides pet owners with a solution for improving their pet care routine through manually controlled and automated play sessions. By combining the different opportunities to control the car, you can create a fun and engaging way to keep your pet active on a daily basis. 

We are making this product because we want to improve the quality of lives for both pets and owners. Smart Pet Buddy offers a solution for pet owners who want to increase the physical and mental activity of their pets indoors. The lack of physical and mental activity may cause the pet to otherwise become depressed, obese and ill.

## Technical information

### How we built Smart Pet Buddy

We have developed a Flutter based application with a simple UI that will allows the user to control the car and avoiding obstacles. We store all information in Google firebase from Flutter (user credentials, etc). For implementing video streaming, we use the camera provided in the SMCE emulator. For the Arduino car, we are  creating an Arduino sketch that holds all the car's functions we require. Communication between car and application go through an MQTT server. The feedback funtction is built using Wiredash.
